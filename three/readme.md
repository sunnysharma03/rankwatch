# rankwatch17_php_screenshot Problem
here the task is to get the screenshot of the submitted url. You can do this by a lot of available js frameworks. I have used phamtomjs with php.
You will need to run the index.html file present in 
```
demo folder
```
The interface is quite cool you can generate the preview in the html page and get the option to save the image or not the image will be saved 
by a default name as demo.
The user can do different action such as you can choose the width and height of the generated image, you can set the clip parameters and can choose 
between jpg or png format.
